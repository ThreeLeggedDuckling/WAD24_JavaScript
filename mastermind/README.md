# About Mastermind Project

## Objective

This is a beginner project in JS.

The objective of this project is to make a simple Mastermind game with a dynamic UI.


## Project Advancement

Here is how I'm trying to proceed :

1. ☑ Create HTML bone structure
2. ☑ Create minimal CSS style
3. ☑ Create info tabs
    1. ☑ Create JSON file with tabs content
    2. ☑ Use data from JSON to create tabs[^1]
    3. ☑ Create functionality to show/hide tabs info on click
4. ☑ Create a try counter
5. ☐ Create game bone structure

Further steps when inital version works :
1. Add choice of difficulty
    - variation of code size
    - variation of tries
    - variation on possible colors
2. Add color theme choice (dark/light)
3. Add temp scoreboard
4. Add timer
5. Calculate score based on score and time

[^1]: To import tabs data from JSOn I use `import data from 'data.json' with {type: 'json'};`.
    This method isn't supported by Mozilla's Firefox as of version 127.0 but should work fine in other browsers.(source : [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_statements_import_import_attributes_type_json))
